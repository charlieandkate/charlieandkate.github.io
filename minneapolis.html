<p>If you are coming from out of town, Kate's parents Ric &amp; Vicki have some activities planned before and after the Wedding Reception.  Please consider staying few days in Minneapolis; summer in Minnesota, the Land of Ten Thousand Lakes, is wonderful.</p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p><strong>Friday evening</strong> Katherine’s aunts and uncles Carol, Bill, Ardy & Mark are hosting a barbeque for all  travelers at Carol & Bill’s home on Lake Minnetonka. Carol & Bill are known for their lakeside hospitality.  Lake Minnetonka is a huge lake a short drive outside of Minneapolis with over 100 miles of lakeshore.  Bring a swimsuit if you think you might want to swim.</p>

<p></p>
<p><strong>Saturday morning and early afternoon</strong> all are invited to stop by Mona &  Michael’s (Katherine’s brother and sister-in-law) home for lounging and  lunch.  We will rent kayaks and canoes to paddle the Chain of Lakes just steps from Michael & Mona’s home in south Minneapolis.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Anyone wanting a bit more culture is invited to arrange to get tickets to see Pride & Prejudice by Jane Austen at the <a href="http://www.guthrietheater.org/">Guthrie Theater</a> in downtown Minneapolis.  The play is at 1PM both Sat & Sun with an evening performance on Sunday at 7PM.</p>
<p></p>

<p><strong>Saturday evening</strong> is of course the big event:  Charlie & Katherine Wedding Reception at the <a href="http://www.bayviewevent.com/">BayView Event Center</a>  on beautiful Lake Minnetonka.</p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p><strong>Sunday morning</strong> all travelers are invited to a brunch at the home of Katherine’s parents overlooking the Mississippi River and downtown Minneapolis.</p>
<p>Accommodation:<br />
Events over the weekend are spread throughout Minneapolis, Wayzata and Excelsior.  We suggest staying near downtown Minneapolis to make getting to and from the airport easy. </p>
<p>We've blocked off rooms at the <a href="http://www.starwoodhotels.com/alofthotels/property/overview/index.html?propertyID=3074">A Loft</a> in Minneapolis at $149/night.  This is directly opposite brunch on Sunday 28th.  The hotel is located a few blocks from the light rail, making transportation to and from the airport quick and inexpensive. For reservations, call 1-877/GO ALOFT and mention &quot;The Rosow Wedding&quot; before Tuesday, June 25th. </p>
